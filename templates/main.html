    <h2 class = "intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p class = 'para' style = "padding-bottom: 5rem;">This project aims to present the findings of research in political polarization in the United State Congress. The project will provide an easy source for those with a casual interest to consume the data along with some key research findings. Additionally, researchers looking to explore patterns in polarization may find utility in this tool to possibly identify patterns that may help them generate new research hypotheses in the areas of history and political science.
    </p>
    <h2 class = "intro">Data</h2>
    <p class = 'para'>
    Our data are every congressional roll call vote in American history mapped onto a bipolar liberal-conservative ideological plane for each Senator and House Representative.  The bipolar ideological scoring system was originally developed by Keith T. Poole and Howard Rosenthal at Carnegie-Mellon University. Metadata on each congressperson is also provided including party affiliation, district, state, as well as other attributes that may be of interest to the project. The data are publicly available and free to download <a href="https://voteview.com" id='voteview'>here</a>.

  <!-- Explanation of NOMINATE -->
  <div class ='container' id="nominate">
      <div class="library">
          <h2 class="library__hed trigger scrollStoryItem inviewport" >Poole & Rosenthal NOMINATE Scores</h2>
          <p class='desc'>The ideological positions used in this project are calculted using a procedure developed by Keith T. Poole and Howard Rosenthal in the 1980s. Dubbed as the legislators DW-NOMINATE (Dynamic Weighted NOMINAl Three-step Estimation), or just NOMINATE, these scores represent congressional members on a spatial map laying between -1 (most liberal) and 1 (most conservative), with the value 0 marking the ideological center. Legislators that are more ideologically similar would be "closer together" on this spatial map with their scores having a shorter distance apart relative to other congressional members. The scores are derived using a complex algorithm that uses every vote they cast during their congressional career, using the fact that more legislators whose ideological positions sometines overlap will vote vote more together, while their more ideologically distat peers will vote less frequently with them. We take you through a brief visual example of how this mapping works.</p>

            <div class="graphic__prose">
              <p class="trigger scrollStoryItem top" data-step="0" style="height: 0px;" id="story0-0"></p>
              <p class="trigger scrollStoryItem inviewport body" data-step="1" style="height: 344.5px;" id="story0-1">We start the example by imaging three fictional legislators: 2 Republicans and 1 Democrat</p>
              <p class="trigger scrollStoryItem body" data-step="2" style="height: 344.5px;" id="story0-2">Imagine these legislators take a series of votes during a given session of congress, with a vote of YEA meaning they support the measure or bill, and a vote of NAY meaning the oppose it.</p>
              <p class="trigger scrollStoryItem body" data-step="3" style="height: 344.5px;" id="story0-3">The two Republicans end up voting together on two votes, signaling their shared beliefs and views.</p>
              <p class="trigger scrollStoryItem body" data-step="4" style="height: 344.5px;" id="story0-4">But one of the Republicans also votes with Democrats some of the time, while the other Republican does not, suggesting that at least this Republican has some ideological overlap with some views held by his Democratic collegues. This would suggest less ideological distance between these two members.</p>
              <p class="trigger scrollStoryItem body" data-step="5" style="height: 344.5px;" id="story0-5">We also see that there are times when all three politicians vote together. Votes like these show us that while the Democrat and far right Republican don't vote often together, they still share some overalap. This will be reflected in their NOMINATE Score being less far apart than they might have otherwise.</p>
              <p class="trigger scrollStoryItem body" data-step="6" style="height: 344.5px;" id="story0-6">Imagine these politicians take many more votes, and we mark how often they the pairs of them vote together. Starting wit the Democrat on the left  and the Republicans on the right, everytime they vote they take steps closer together or further apart on this line.</p>
              <p class="trigger scrollStoryItem body" data-step="7" style="height: 344.5px;" id="story0-7">We might end up with something like this, with the Democrat taking a value of around -0.38, while the two Republicans have values of 0.15 and 0.42. Notice that the Republican that sometimes votes with the Democrat is pulled closer to the center as a result.</p>
              <p class="trigger scrollStoryItem last" data-step="8" style="height: 344.5px;" id="story0-8">We can repeat this process for every legislator in a congressional session, noting who the Democrats and Republicans are, and measuring how simialr they are to one another relative to others in Congress. Note how some Democrats can have values above zero and Republicans can ahve values below zero!</p>

      <p class = 'para'>Now that you've been introduced to DW-NOMINATE scores, lets take a look at what they show us. The chart below shows the NOMINATE Score for every member of Congress from 1950 until today, with each small circle represents an individual member of congress. It also shows the average NOMINATE score for both the Republicans and the Democrats. Explore the plot to learn about the timeline of the ideological divide between the two parties. Compare States to the national figures, or to other states to see which began to become more polarized and when.</p>

      <h4>The Evolution of Polarization</h4>
      <p class = 'para'> During the early part of the post war period, after the 1940's, Republicans and Demcrats had much more ideological overlap. This can be seen by the number of points, individual legislators, from both parties falling around and across the zero line where the ideological center is. By the mid 1990's this space representing the ideological center was completely abandoned by both parties.</p>
